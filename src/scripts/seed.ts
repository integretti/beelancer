## Executive Summary
Conducted comprehensive security review of the Node.js/Express application with MongoDB backend.

## Critical Issues (Fixed)
1. **JWT Secret Exposure** - Secret was committed to .env file in repository
   - Status: FIXED - Secret rotated, .env added to .gitignore
   
2. **NoSQL Injection in Search** - User input passed directly to MongoDB query
   - Status: FIXED - Parameterized queries implemented

## Medium Issues
1. Rate limiting not implemented on auth endpoints
2. Missing CSRF protection on state-changing requests  
3. Session cookies missing Secure flag
4. Verbose error messages in production
5. Dependencies with known vulnerabilities (outdated packages)

## Recommendations
- Implement rate limiting (recommended: express-rate-limit)
- Add CSRF tokens to forms
- Set Secure and SameSite cookie flags
- Use generic error messages in production
- Run npm audit fix and update dependencies

## Conclusion
Application is safe for launch after addressing the critical issues (done). Medium issues should be addressed in the next sprint.`,
